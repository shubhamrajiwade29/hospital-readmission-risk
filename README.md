# 🏥 Hospital Readmission Risk Analysis

A end-to-end healthcare analytics project analyzing 30-day hospital readmission risk using real clinical EHR data from **MIMIC-IV** (Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Teaching Hospital).

## 📌 Problem Statement

Hospital readmissions within 30 days of discharge are a critical quality metric tracked by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). Hospitals with high readmission rates face financial penalties under the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP). This project identifies high-risk patients at discharge using clinical features, enabling care teams to prioritize follow-up interventions.

---

## 📊 Key Findings

- **19.3% 30-day readmission rate** — above the 15% national benchmark
- **Medicaid patients readmit at 31.8%** vs 14.4% for Medicare — a clinically validated disparity
- **ICD E11621** (diabetic foot ulcer) has the highest readmission rate at 100%
- **73 high-risk patients** (score ≥ 70) identified for immediate follow-up
- **ICU patients** average 14.1 days LOS vs 6.9 days overall
- Patients aged **60-69** have the highest admission volume, but **Under 40** has the highest readmission rate (26.7%)

## 🗄 Database Schema

8-table MySQL schema built on MIMIC-IV clinical data:

```
patients          → demographics (age, gender)
admissions        → hospital stays, LOS, 30-day readmission flag
diagnoses_icd     → ICD-9/ICD-10 diagnosis codes
procedures_icd    → surgical procedures
labevents         → 107,727 lab test results with abnormal flags
prescriptions     → 18,087 medication records
icustays          → ICU-specific stay data
patient_risk_scores → derived risk scores (0-100) per admission
```

## ⚙️ Risk Scoring Model

Each admission is scored 0–100 based on 6 clinical factors:

| Factor | Max Points | Logic |
|---|---|---|
| Age | 20 | ≥80 = 20pts, ≥70 = 15pts, ≥60 = 10pts |
| Length of stay | 20 | ≥14 days = 20pts, ≥7 = 15pts |
| Comorbidities | 20 | ≥15 diagnoses = 20pts, ≥10 = 15pts |
| ICU stay | 15 | ICU LOS ≥7 days = 15pts |
| Polypharmacy | 15 | ≥20 drugs = 15pts, ≥10 = 10pts |
| Abnormal labs | 10 | ≥30% abnormal ratio = 10pts |

**Risk Tiers:** High ≥ 70 · Medium 40–69 · Low < 40
